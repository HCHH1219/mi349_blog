        <p><div class="img-container01">Bubble Bobble is a 2D platform game developed by Taito and released on June 16, 1986.
            In the gameplay, players need to control the character to move on a 2D map, avoid and attack the enemy by pressing attack key and jump key. When the enemy on the map is cleaned up, the player will automatically enter the next level. The gameplay is interesting to me, and the attack method fits the name of the game; when the player presses the attack key, a bubble will be shot out, and the enemy touched by the bubble will be wrapped and brought by the bubbles; when the player attacks the enemy again, the enemy will fall on the ground and become fruits. Players can get fruits to earn score rewards.
        </p></div>
        <p><img alt="in-game-image02" src="Blog-images/Bubblebobble.png"></p>
        <p><div class="img-container02">I think that there are two advantages of the game: the first, random bonus items will appear on the map during the game. Every time a bonus item appears, it means that players can earn a higher score in the same level, and the number of scores is one of the important sources of the game that allows players to have positive feedback, so I think this design is interesting and necessary, at the same time, some randomness is added to the game. Second, in each level, if there is only one enemy rested on the map, it will become a state of anger in just several seconds, and the enemy's movement speed and response speed are twice as fast as before. This mechanism makes enemy have more changes; I also noticed that the enemy did not immediately become a state of anger, it may be because the fast speed of response will cause difficulty for players to react, which may reduce the game experience.  
        </p></div>
        <p><div class="img-container03">Of course, Bubble Bobble also has some things that I think are not good enough. First it the control feeling. When I control the character to move left and right and jump up to the upper platform, I think there is no problem with the control, but when I want to jump back to the down platform, I must find a gap and land to the down platform through the gap. I personally don't like this. I know that many games have such designs, like Mario, but the level design of Bubble Bobble is different from Mario: Mario allows players to walk freely within a certain range; the map of each level is closed, the moveable range is much smaller than Mario's, and the number of Bubble Bobble's enemies of each level has more than three. Players need a more flexible way of controlling; players cannot go the down platform directly which limit the control is negative feedback for me.  
        </p></div>
        <p><div class="img-container04"></div>In general, I still like the design of this game. I want to try the new vision of Bubble Bobble on Switch platform if I have a chance; I want to see what new game mechanisms and visual effects can be brought to the old game through new technologies.

        <p>Satisfactory is a exploration and construction game, the main gameplay is that use the resources of the open map to build a production line to obtain advanced materials and equipment. This game was released on 19 March 2019 in Epic store and 8 June 2020 in Steam; I played it in Steam.  
        </p>
        
        <div class="masthead">

        </div>

        <p>The game can be separated into three parts: exploration, collection, and construction. The map is large, and exploring the entire map can take quite a while. As players explore, players can encounter a variety of ecosystems, each with its own feature. There are some aggressive animals and plants hiding in these environments, as well as animals with gentle personalities. During the exploration, players need to collect resources on the map for their own use: Players can choose to collect and make most of the materials by hand, or they can choose to make materials by machine. "Making" can be subdivided into two parts: building machines out of materials and building materials out of machines; Players use the materials they collect to produce more advanced materials or to build machines for automated production. I think this part is the most interesting to me. 
        </p>
        <p>The game gives the player multiple stages, and with each stage unlocked, the player gets permission to build more efficient machines and more advanced materials. These efficient machines need to be built with advanced materials, and the conditions for obtaining advanced materials are strict. Like Matryoshka dolls, players can quickly open one Matryoshka doll by hand, but not ten Matryoshka dolls at the same time. At this point, the player must start by building the base production machine, and gradually expand and upgrade the equipment. When the player reaches a certain level, there is something satisfying about standing on high and watching your massive production plant automate the production of materials, just like the name of the game. The gameplay allows this game to distinguish with other construction games. In my opinion, this game also has disadvantages.
        </p>
        <p>First, there are too few kinds of animals on the map. Although the map is large and contains many ecological environments, the species of animals in each ecological environment are almost the same. For example, they live in both woods and wastelands. A small amount of attacking style and behaviors also make them have low presence in the game. This also resulted in a low desire to build more advanced weapons because I didn't think it was necessary. 
        </p>
        <p>Second, late gameplay time is dominated by waiting. Late in the game, the materials needed to level up are both very advanced and in large quantities, and a single advanced material can take a few minutes to build. To quickly have number of advanced materials, players need to repeat the same process repeatedly, building the same production line. The process is boring and tedious. If players don't want to repeat the same process, they can wait. This is a problem that I think can be fatal to a game, where the player gets distracted by something other than the game while waiting and loses interest in the game itself.
        </p>
        <p>About the second one, the game did something to fix it. In the process of production, a surplus of low-grade materials is produced, which can be redeemed for tickets; tickets can be redeemed for items unrelated to the core gameplay to add some fun. But this approach is far from enough.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, I still think this is a good game. I look forward to the follow -up update method of this game. I hope the game can break through the existing framework to add more interesting content.
